# i3_Powermenu

I couldn't get rofi to work so I just made my own powermenu.

The powermenu uses xfce4-terminal and takes advantage of the i3 config keybinds to make it a floating window to simulate a seprate menu. It's essentially just opening a new floating terminal and bashing a powermenu script that I made.

It uses vim keybinds because I want to get better at navigating vim and features a confirmation page in case you misclick a power option.
